Happy New Year! I'm ready to restart my post-Hackbright job search after a busy holiday season. 

I wasn't sure where to begin, so I got in touch with Wendy from Career Services at Hackbright and she gave me some great ideas!


To-do list (due 1/13):

1. Dedicate 30min to 2 hours per day to coding
	- Review:
		- Get back on GitHub, possibly reorganize/consolidate old files
		- Create a repo for useful links/documents/notes 
	- Check out new HB Material
	- Start new project or work more on old Hackbright project
2. Resume Overhaul - email to HB mentor and Wendy to review
3. Attend Weekly Whiteboarding for HB-Alum
